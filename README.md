## Greetings, I'm a fire and storm-breathing code dragon! 🔥⛈️

My name is Akub or as some people like to say Hyper, and I am an IT enthusiast who also happens to be a dragon. I have the power to breathe both fire and storms, and I use those powers to create amazing things with code.
## 🔥⛈️ Elements of Choice

My elements of choice are fire and storms. I can unleash a scorching blaze or a powerful thunderstorm at will, and I love to use those powers to solve complex coding challenges.
## 🎯 Current Quest

My current quest is to create world better and easier, which will require all of my dragon skills and powers to achieve.
## 💬 Roar

When I'm facing a tough challenge, my roar echoes across the land like a thunderclap. It's a reminder to myself and my enemies that I am a dragon to be reckoned with.
## 📫 Let's Soar

Do you want to join me on a flight through the clouds? Or perhaps you'd like to collaborate with me on a coding project? You can reach me through email on my github page, and I'm always up for new adventures.
## ⚡ Fun Fact

In addition to coding and unleashing my dragon powers, I'm also a Photographer, 2D/3D artist. I've even found a way to incorporate my dragon skills into this hobby, which has led to some pretty epic results.

Thanks for stopping by, and let's create something amazing together! 🐉
